We want our children to have equal access at daycare, in the classroom, and in public spaces. But what about in our own homes? Here are some tips for making your home more deaf-friendly, including some if you are designing or renovating:</span></p><ul><li><span class="OYPEnA font-feature-liga-off font-feature-clig-off font-feature-calt-off text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none"><strong><a href="https://www.aussiedeafkids.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rlt-how-make-home-deaf-friendly.pdf"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-16378" src="https://www.aussiedeafkids.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rlt-how-make-home-deaf-friendly.webp" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>Reduce background noise</strong>:</span><span class="OYPEnA font-feature-liga-off font-feature-clig-off font-feature-calt-off text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none"> This is especially important when having conversations with children who wear devices as it will reduce their listening effort and minimise misunderstandings.</span></li><li><span class="OYPEnA font-feature-liga-off font-feature-clig-off font-feature-calt-off text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none"><strong>Provide good and even lighting</strong>:</span><span class="OYPEnA font-feature-liga-off font-feature-clig-off font-feature-calt-off text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none"> Consistent and balanced lighting throughout the home will enable your child to lip read more easily, and to see your facial expressions or Auslan signs more clearly. Close curtains or blinds to diffuse direct sunlight that can obscure features, expressions, and movements.</span></li><li><span class="OYPEnA font-feature-liga-off font-feature-clig-off font-feature-calt-off text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none"><strong>Incorporating visual and tactile alerts</strong>: </span><span class="OYPEnA font-feature-liga-off font-feature-clig-off font-feature-calt-off text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none">Once your child is a little older, you will want to ensure they can hear smoke alarms, doorbells and telephones, especially if they are home alone.</span></li><li><span class="OYPEnA font-feature-liga-off font-feature-clig-off font-feature-calt-off text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none"><strong>Round dinner table</strong>:</span><span class="OYPEnA font-feature-liga-off font-feature-clig-off font-feature-calt-off text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none"> This also aids with lip reading and signing as your child can see everyone’s face and hands at the table, and the direction of sound is more from the front.</span></li><li><span class="OYPEnA font-feature-liga-off font-feature-clig-off font-feature-calt-off text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none"><strong>Wall colours</strong>:</span><span class="OYPEnA font-feature-liga-off font-feature-clig-off font-feature-calt-off text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none"> Solid wall colours are good. Avoid patterns and reflective colours, as these distract the eye from lips, facial expressions and signs.</span></li><li><span class="OYPEnA font-feature-liga-off font-feature-clig-off font-feature-calt-off text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none"><strong>Use captions</strong>: </span><span class="OYPEnA font-feature-liga-off font-feature-clig-off font-feature-calt-off text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none">It is never too early to make information more accessible.</span></li><li><span class="OYPEnA font-feature-liga-off font-feature-clig-off font-feature-calt-off text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none"><strong>Use carpets, rugs and other soft furnishings</strong>:</span><span class="OYPEnA font-feature-liga-off font-feature-clig-off font-feature-calt-off text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none"> Hard, reflective surfaces can cause echoes and reverberations that can degrade hearing.</span></li><li><span class="OYPEnA font-feature-liga-off font-feature-clig-off font-feature-calt-off text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none"><strong>Lower ceilings</strong>:</span><span class="OYPEnA font-feature-liga-off font-feature-clig-off font-feature-calt-off text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none"> These also improve the acoustics in the home.</span></li><li><span class="OYPEnA font-feature-liga-off font-feature-clig-off font-feature-calt-off text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none"><strong>Open floor plans</strong>: </span><span class="OYPEnA font-feature-liga-off font-feature-clig-off font-feature-calt-off text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none">Allow for a better line of sight, however, there can be a tradeoff with poorer acoustics. Openness is beneficial for those using Auslan, especially in the space that links the kitchen with the main living area, as this is where most household conversations occur.</span></li><li><span class="OYPEnA font-feature-liga-off font-feature-clig-off font-feature-calt-off text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none"><strong>Wider hallways</strong>: </span><span class="OYPEnA font-feature-liga-off font-feature-clig-off font-feature-calt-off text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none"><span class="OYPEnA font-feature-liga-off font-feature-clig-off font-feature-calt-off text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none">Walking side by side while communicating is essential for someone who relies on lip reading or sign language.</span></span><p> </p></li></ul><p><a href="https://www.aussiedeafkids.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rlt-how-make-home-deaf-friendly.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Download the Real Life Tips infographic.</strong></a></p><p><strong>More information:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://todayshomeowner.com/blog/guides/home-design-for-hearing-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Home design for hearing loss</a> | Todays Home Owner</li><li><a href="https://www.ndcs.org.uk/information-and-support/language-and-communication/creating-a-good-communication-environment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Creating a good communication environment</a> | NDCS UK</li><li><a href="https://www.aussiedeafkids.org.au/resources/your-childs-hearing/unilateral-hearing-loss/creating-a-good-listening-environment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Creating a good listening environment</a></li><li><a href="https://www.aussiedeafkids.org.au/its-never-too-early-to-start-using-captions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It&#8217;s never too early to start using captions</a></li></ul>						</div>

I quickly started imagining what our new baby would look like: their first words, their first day of school, their first date, their wedding day. I was so lucky to be having a baby! </p><p>Arthur was our first child, and we were over the moon, knowing we would soon be parents.</p><p>Fast forward to the birth of our gorgeous little man. I couldn&#8217;t have imagined a better labour than the one we had. Bringing him into the world, I was again flooded with happiness, knowing I had delivered a healthy baby boy! It felt like life couldn&#8217;t get any better. But then we were introduced to the SWISH test (the newborn hearing screening test done at the hospital after a baby is born). </p><p>Arthur had his first hearing screen at just 4 hours old. It was a straight-up &#8220;Fail&#8221;. The screener reassured us that this was fairly common for the first screen and that she would be back the next day to re-screen Arthur. The lovely lady told us there was &#8220;nothing to worry about&#8221;, and as new parents at the ripe old age of 22 holding our 4-hour-old brand new baby boy, we didn&#8217;t worry—not one bit. </p><p>Arthur had four more SWISH tests before we were referred to the Deafness Centre at Westmead Children&#8217;s Hospital. They had told us things like, &#8220;He&#8217;s probably still got fluid in his ears from being in your belly&#8221; and &#8220;We&#8217;ve just updated our machine this morning, so that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s coming up as a fail.&#8221; </p><p>And we were continually told &#8220;Not to worry.&#8221; So we never did. </p><p>On 20th March 2023 at 9 am, the audiologist took us into a soundproof room in Westmead Children&#8217;s Hospital where I fed Arthur to sleep and swaddled him up nice and cosy so they could begin the 3-hour long hearing testing. They ended the test after just 45 minutes. They handed Arthur back to me and told us to follow them back upstairs to their office. With this, I said to my husband, &#8220;They have only been going 45 minutes; they must have realised he is perfectly fine and didn&#8217;t want to waste any more of our time.&#8221; Looking back now, we were very naive to think this. </p><p>Our lovely audiologist took us into her office, waited for us to sit down, and broke the news. Arthur had indeed ‘failed’ and was diagnosed with Moderate Sensorineural Hearing loss bilaterally. And with this hearing loss, he will need to wear hearing aids for the rest of his life.</p><p>My world stopped. </p><p>All those wonderful things I&#8217;d imagined for my baby &#8211; his first words, his first day of school, his wedding day. All of these things now made me feel sick and empty. I started to grieve these things when my baby was only six weeks old. I didn’t understand why we deserved this to happen to us. I didn&#8217;t even know children could be deaf! I thought my son would never be able to speak and would never be able to be a &#8220;normal&#8221; kid.</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-14194" src="https://www.aussiedeafkids.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_8096-rotated.jpeg" alt="" width="320" height="427" />Fast-forward to May 2024. At 15 months old, I can&#8217;t believe the little boy Arthur is becoming. He can sign some basic signs. He can say, &#8220;Mumma&#8221;—and it&#8217;s the most amazing thing I&#8217;ve ever heard! He is smashing his milestones and early intervention sessions and living life to the fullest. He is a free-spirited, stubborn, cheeky, happy little guy. </p><p>Connecting with other parents who are on this same journey through Facebook groups and other social media has helped so much; it&#8217;s comforting to know we aren&#8217;t going through this alone. </p><p>I wish I could have seen into the future back in that office at just 6 weeks old, that this diagnosis would not stop him from being amazing! And that, really, it&#8217;s just an extra superpower—his supersonic ears, as we call them, make him, HIM. </p><p>We are so lucky and blessed to be the parents of a DHH child.</p><p>Olivia &#8211; Arthur&#8217;s mum &#8211; July 2024</p>						</div>
