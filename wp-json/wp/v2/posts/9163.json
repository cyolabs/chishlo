Deafness and hearing loss are complex issues that affect each child differently. A social model of disability accepts their individual differences and removes barriers so they can participate in their community and develop a positive sense of belonging in the world. It may be helpful to teach them about the social model of disability.<\/p><p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.aussiedeafkids.org.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/rlt-social-model-of-disability.pdf\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-16669 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/www.aussiedeafkids.org.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/rlt-social-model-of-disability.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>The Australian Federation of Disability Organisations explains the social model of disability on their website, which says:<\/p><p class=\"p1\">\u201cThe social model of disability is a way of viewing the world, developed by people with disability.<\/p><p class=\"p1\">The social model of disability says that people are disabled by barriers in society, such as buildings not having a ramp or accessible toilets, or people\u2019s attitudes, like assuming people with disability can\u2019t do certain things.<\/p><p class=\"p1\">The medical model of disability says people are disabled by their impairments or differences, and looks at what is \u2018wrong\u2019 with the person, not what the person needs. We believe that the medical model of disability creates low expectations and leads to people losing independence, choice and control in their lives.<\/p><p class=\"p1\">The social model helps us recognise barriers that make life harder for people with disability. Removing these barriers creates equality and offers people with disability more independence, choice and control.\u201d<\/p><p class=\"p1\">Example: The problem isn\u2019t that your child cannot hear the educational video, it is that the video is not captioned nor has Auslan interpretation.<\/p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Need to put following in table:<\/span><\/p><p>Medical Model of Deafness<\/p><p>Social Model of Deafness<\/p><p>The focus is on the hearing loss<\/p><p>The focus is on the individual<\/p><p>Hearing loss is a personal problem that needs to be fixed<\/p><p>Hearing loss is an individual difference that needs to be accommodated<\/p><p>The person with hearing loss should adapt to fit into society<\/p><p>Society should accommodate people who are deaf or hard of hearing so they can participate in all activities<\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.aussiedeafkids.org.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/rlt-social-model-of-disability.pdf\"><strong>Download the Real Life Tips infographic.<\/strong><\/a><\/p><p><strong>More information:<\/strong><\/p><ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.afdo.org.au\/social-model-of-disability\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Social model of disability<\/a> | Australian Federation of Disability Organisations<\/li><\/ul>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As parents of children with hearing loss, we want to protect our kids from discrimination and ensure they have equal access in society.
