Like an involuntary verbal tic, I would call her \u2018deaf\u2019 before I said her name or anything else about her.<\/p><p>This new tendency was the result of many obsessive days spent reading about what the diagnosis meant. Suddenly a host of alien words had intruded on our lives and I drove myself mad trying to work them out.<\/p><p>At first I wasn\u2019t sure what term to use to describe the diagnosis itself. There was the medical vocabulary: it was a sensorineural, (most likely) congenital, bilateral, moderate-severe\/profound hearing loss. To the lay-person, this roughly equates to \u2018nerve deafness\u2019 in both ears from birth.<\/p><p>These definitions were cloaked in the mystery of a clinical world we had arrived in but did not yet understand. They were cold and impersonal but I found I could practice saying them, turn them over in my mind and get used to their presence.<\/p><p>The words I was really scared to speak out loud were the more commonly used descriptions like \u2018hearing impaired\u2019, \u2018hard of hearing\u2019, \u2018deaf\u2019 (people who have a physical condition of hearing loss) and \u2018Deaf\u2019 (people who use Auslan; identify as members of the signing Deaf community).<\/p><p>Or\u00a0<em>disability<\/em>\u2014that one was like acid on my tongue.<\/p><p>I tried them all on for size, testing the degree of pain they elicited in me. It only took one syllable to break me back then.<\/p><p>My fixation on the nomenclature was really just my way to grapple with what was happening to us. Our situation felt more real (and not like some nightmare starring Max Schreck) if I could give it a name.<\/p><p>I settled on \u2018deaf\u2019 because \u2018hearing impaired\u2019 is regarded negatively by members of the Deaf community who prefer the term \u2018Deaf\u2019 and \u2018hard of hearing\u2019 (and I am such a\u00a0<em>stickler<\/em>\u00a0for the rules).<\/p><p>\u2018Hard of hearing\u2019 just brought forth the image of an old man straining to hear through an ancient ear trumpet. We did not yet use Auslan and had no ancestral or existing links to the Deaf community.<\/p><p>So in the end it was deaf with a little \u2018d\u2019 that felt about right to me.<\/p><p>Amelia had just turned 2, so no-one asked her what she thought about this. She couldn\u2019t have told us anyway because the terms that so consumed me were simply lost on her.<\/p><p>I am a little ashamed to admit that once I decided I was okay to call Amelia deaf to myself, I just couldn\u2019t stop flinging the word at complete strangers, usually without necessity or context.<\/p><p>I was probably a little deranged by grief, but I gave little or no thought for consideration for my girl\u2014the deaf one \u2013 and how it shaped her identity.<\/p><p>One day we walked into the chemist and the saleswoman leaned over the counter to look at Amelia tucked in her pram.<\/p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s so sweet! Hello little girl what\u2019s your name?\u201d<\/p><p>Like a Venus fly trap, I snapped her question in half with, \u201cShe can\u2019t hear you, because she\u2019s\u00a0<em>deaf<\/em>\u2026\u201d<\/p><p>I said it callously, as though she should have known it just by looking at Amelia. It made the woman flustered and uncomfortable and on some sick level I was glad.<\/p><p>It was a perverse thing to do but I repeated this routine often with people who were new to us. It was my conversational trump card. I used it to provoke sympathy, to disconcert people, or to neutralise their judgement (she\u2019s not naughty, she\u2019s just\u00a0<em>deaf<\/em>). One more time for the cheap seats.<\/p><p>What I think I was trying to do in my desperation was prove that I was not ashamed of Amelia\u2019s deafness. I pushed it into people\u2019s faces so they would have to deal with the fact we could not escape ourselves. I might as well have propped a sign on her pram saying \u2018deaf child on board\u2019.<\/p><p>For a time, I simply forgot to encourage people to see Amelia beyond the feature that was actually invisible to them \u2013 her deafness. Inadvertently, I boxed her up and labelled her because I was the one who couldn\u2019t see past it.<\/p><p>Thankfully it was just a phase I was going through to deal with the shock and grief, and it didn\u2019t last. I explained my behaviour to Amelia\u2019s Deaf Educator, AH, and she seemed to understand what was happening and why.<\/p><p>She gently told me not to worry about other people and to think of Amelia and her needs first, before the deafness, before anything. That was all that mattered, not words.<\/p><p>The fact is I\u00a0<em>was<\/em>\u00a0(and am) extremely proud of Amelia\u2019s deafness. It\u2019s anomalous that the thing that almost destroyed me was the same thing that made her more special in my eyes. But I realise I did a huge disservice to her to have made \u2018deaf\u2019 the opening number, before people had a chance to hear other songs in Amelia\u2019s repertoire.<\/p><p>There are many ways to honour that unique part of who she is, through learning Auslan and establishing relationships with deaf adults and children, without consigning her to an all-encompassing label.<\/p><p>In some situations, it is absolutely necessary to let people know that Amelia is deaf to maximise her social interactions (background noise is too loud, don\u2019t stand behind her and speak).<\/p><p>If someone asks about her hearing aids or her sign language then I am happy to go there, but there\u2019s no reason to keep assailing people with her deafness on a regular basis.<\/p><p>While I have made a decision to use one word among many to describe Amelia\u2019s hearing loss, this may not be her preference later on. In my experience, not all young people with a hearing loss identify as \u2018deaf\u2019 or even \u2018hearing impaired\u2019; It\u2019s a complex choice based on many factors I\u2019m only just beginning to comprehend.<\/p><p>One day, Amelia might tell me that she has a different way of explaining her deafness (and herself).<\/p><p>I have no idea what that discussion will be like, but I want to be sure to tell her that I now see her deafness as only\u00a0<em>one<\/em>\u00a0important part of who she is: my girl who is blonde, powerfully strong, mischievous, and loves to dance even when she can\u2019t hear any music.<\/p><p>When she is old enough, I also want her to watch a brilliant video posted on YouTube by\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/positivelyhear\/videos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bethany<\/a>, a teenage girl with a cochlear implant called \u2018<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Wli6HIfCDmg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MUSINGS ABOUT BEING WHO I AM\u00a0<\/a>\u2013 \u00a0Deaf or Not.\u2019 It says so much about the limiting effects of labels we don\u2019t choose for ourselves, the genuine pride that leads parents to insist on them and the need to take ownership of how we present ourselves as individuals to the world.<\/p><p>Bethany says: \u201cSo this is me. I am deaf. So guess what? I can still do anything. So why should it change your opinion of me?\u201d<\/p><p>Why indeed.<\/p><hr \/><p>Thank you to Melinda Hildebrandt for permission to reproduce this chapter from her book,\u00a0<em>Amelia &amp; Me.<\/em><br \/>For more information:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/melindahildebrandt.com.au\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http:\/\/melindahildebrandt.com.au\/<\/a><\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the months following Amelia\u2019s diagnosis of hearing loss, I picked up a strange habit when introducing her to people we met in our daily travels.
