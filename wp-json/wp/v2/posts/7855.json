We were confident that giving the students some knowledge was the best way to limit negative experiences.<\/p><p>We met with the Principal and the Year 2 teachers at her new school and proposed doing a presentation to the students before the end of the school year.\u00a0 Indy was due to start at the beginning of Year 3.\u00a0 The school was very accommodating. I drafted a short presentation giving simple explanations about hearing loss, the benefits and limitations of hearing aids, and the reason for using other assistive devices in the classroom.\u00a0 I asked Indy if she wanted to be involved in the interactive presentation and thankfully she was keen to do so.\u00a0<\/p><p>On the day of the presentation, we stood at the front of the Year 2 students and teachers and asked if anyone had grandparents or friends\/family that wore hearing aids. We explained that hearing aids are everyday devices that help people to hear.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>We passed around some of my daughter\u2019s old hearing aids for the children to look at, showed them the Roger FM that the teacher would be wearing and the handheld microphone that the children could use in the classroom for interactive sessions. We talked about the small adjustments needed to help Indy hear, such as making sure they get her attention before talking to her, letting her see their mouth while talking, and the importance of her itinerant support teacher.<\/p><p>Towards the end of the presentation, we involved the students in a little game. They took turns using the remote microphone, which was connected to Indy\u2019s aids. Indy left the classroom and went out into the hallway.\u00a0 The children were prompted to quietly ask a question using the remote microphone and then Indy would come back into the classroom and answer their question.\u00a0 Her future classmates were very impressed!<\/p><p>The transition to her new school the following year went very smoothly. There was no fuss made and her peers were very accepting of her.\u00a0 We were so glad we had done the presentation to her new classmates!<\/p><p><strong>More information:<\/strong><\/p><ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.aussiedeafkids.org.au\/sharing-information-with-teachers-and-classmates\/\">RLT &#8211; Sharing information with teachers and classmates<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My daughter has bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and wears hearing aids.
