The lessons are for the parent\/s to absorb and put into practice at home.<\/p><p>The responsibility to keep the thread of therapy running through every experience is important, but some days, it is a heavy duty leaving no room for spontaneous, non-teachable moments with our little ones, let alone their hearing siblings.<\/p><p>I remember so well the feeling of trying to get my very complex daughter to and from yet another stressful session where her escalating behavioural issues threatened to pull the waiting room walls down and bury us within.<\/p><p>Or the sense of judgement that I was somehow to blame for my child\u2019s inability to attend to a task that no part of her was able to understand. \u201cIt would be a shame if she was seen to be a\u00a0<em>naughty<\/em>\u00a0child\u2026\u201d<\/p><p>And the guilt I felt wondering if the cost \u2013 to our family life, to the emotional health of my daughter, to my sanity &#8211; of all of that therapy, therapy, therapy, was worth it if my child\u2019s hearing loss was deteriorating and the delay to her speech was growing more severe still.<\/p><p>But inside all of that chaos and stress remains space to make decisions that are just for you and your family.<\/p><p>For me, it was a six-month pause in all therapy appointments. No more screaming meltdowns and sweat running down my too-tired face trying to drag my girl out of school where she felt safe and was gaining valuable skills to endure her third appointment for the week.<\/p><p>No more. There is always space to say \u201cenough\u201d, just for now or longer if you need to.<\/p><p>Let my child just BE. Let them go to school and come home and watch television and laugh at silly things.<\/p><p><em>Thank you to Melinda Hilderbrandt for her literary touch on this parent story.<\/em><\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This story represents the stories of parents whose children are deaf or hard of hearing with additional needs.
