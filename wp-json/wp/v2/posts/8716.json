Or perhaps no device at all.<\/p><p>Adjusting to what it all means for you and your child takes time, and the learning curve is steep with a barrage of tests and appointments that comprise this new world you\u2019ve been thrust into. You may not have been here before, but it\u00a0<em>is<\/em>\u00a0where you live now.<\/p><p>But the remarkable feat of strength it takes to adapt to that first hearing loss diagnosis does not always prepare us for the ongoing ups and downs of gradual or sudden changes to our children\u2019s health.<\/p><p>Maybe it\u2019s when your child doesn\u2019t seem to be responding as well to your voice. Are their hearing aids working, or is it something else? Or are they suddenly acting out or becoming increasingly withdrawn in ways that their diagnosis cannot adequately explain?<\/p><p>It\u2019s so important to listen to your instincts during these times. Heed that voice inside your head that shouts at you to\u00a0<em>do something<\/em>. It\u2019s ALWAYS okay to raise your fears with someone in a position to listen and help, whatever the outcome.<\/p><p>Because if that anxiety in your gut was a sign that you were reacting to that something\u00a0<em>more<\/em>, like a permanent drop in hearing or an additional diagnosis like autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or global developmental delay, then you have done more than confirm that you were right to raise a red flag.<\/p><p>In fighting to understand the evolving picture of what your little person is dealing with, you have given them the best possible chance to access the vital help they need.<\/p><div><p>So never forget that\u00a0<em>you\u00a0<\/em>are your child\u2019s best advocate, because nobody on earth knows them better than you.<\/p><p><em>Thank you to Melinda Hilderbrandt for her literary touch on this parent story.<\/em><\/p><\/div>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This story represents the stories of parents whose children are deaf or hard of hearing with additional needs.
